Here you go, Vasanth! Here's a clean, beginner-friendly **README.md** for your `call_analytics` project, written in an engaging tone with structured sections.

# 📞 Call Analytics with LLMs using Django

Welcome to **Call Analytics**, a Django-based project that leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and sentiment analysis to understand **why customers are calling** — even when there's **no review**! If there's a review, we skip the call transcript — smart and efficient. 😎

---

## 🔍 What Does This Do?

This project helps analyze **customer call transcripts** by:
- Detecting **sentiment** (Positive / Negative / Frustrated / Neutral)
- Identifying the **reason for the call** using an LLM (powered by Groq + LangChain)
- Storing results in a database for **future analytics**
- (Optional) Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to suggest answers based on documents like FAQs or warranty info.

It’s like giving your customer service team a superpower. ⚡

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

> Make sure you have Python installed. Recommended: `python 3.9+`

### 1. Clone and install requirements

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/call_analytics.git
cd call_analytics
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set up your environment

Create a `.env` file like this:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 3. Run migrations & start the server

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

## 🧠 Technologies Used

| Feature                   | Tool/Library               |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Web Framework            | Django                     |
| LLM Integration          | LangChain + Groq API       |
| Sentiment Analysis       | HuggingFace transformers   |
| NLP Keyword Extraction   | spaCy                      |
| Vector Search (RAG)      | FAISS / ChromaDB (optional)|
| Charting (Planned)       | Chart.js / Plotly          |

## 🔄 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. Upload or receive a **transcript**.
2. If it's a **review**, skip processing.
3. Else, run:
   - **Sentiment classification**
   - **Reason extraction** using Groq LLM
   - (Optional) Search PDFs for related info using RAG
4. Save all of it into a database.
5. (Soon) Show graphs of trends like “Most common issues”, “Sentiment over time”, etc.

---

## 📈 Future Plans

- 📊 Add dashboards with filters
- 🌐 Build a frontend for non-technical users
- 🧠 Fine-tune LLM prompts
- 📨 CSV upload support for bulk transcripts

Let me know if you want this in your project folder as an actual file — I can generate and place it in the `CALL_ANALYTICS` directory too. Want me to do that?
